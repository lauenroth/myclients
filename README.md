# MyClients

This is an app to manage clients, invoices and time tracking for freelancers and smaller companies.

This project is still work in progress and was initially meant as a playground for some technologies I wanted to test or improve on (like tailwind).

## Tools

The app is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Inspirations for time tracking:

- Klokki
- Clockify
- Toggl Track
- MyHours
- TimeCamp
